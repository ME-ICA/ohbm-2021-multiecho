## Open Science Room (Proposed) Emergent Session: Multi-echo fMRI in practice

 Multi-echo fMRI is an acquisition method where data is acquired at multiple echo times after each excitation pulse. This information can be used to reduce signal dropout and quantitatively identify and remove signal that is unlikely to be neural in origin. Multi-echo fMRI acquisitions and processing methods have sufficiently matured to the point where the growing developer and user community would benefit from a discussion of what it’s like to use multi-echo fMRI in practice. In this emergent session, presenters will briefly answer three questions: (1) Why are you using multi-echo fMRI? (2) Are there any challenges of multi-echo fMRI that you’ve addressed and want to highlight? (3) What issue(s) with multi-echo fMRI would you like to see addressed? These presentations will be followed with time for discussion between presenters and attendees.

 If you are interested in presenting in this session or have thoughts for how to organize the session, please contact one of the organizers directly or [comment on issue #1](https://github.com/ME-ICA/ohbm-2021-multiecho/issues/1).

## Multi-echo posters and presentations

 This will be a place to centralize multi-echo related content at OHBM 2021. Eventually someone will go through the abstract book to identify content to include here, but if you have content you want included, submit a pull request or [comment on this issue #2](https://github.com/ME-ICA/ohbm-2021-multiecho/issues/2).
