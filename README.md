## Open Science Room (Proposed) Emergent Session: Multi-echo fMRI in practice

Multi-echo fMRI is an acquisition method where data is acquired at multiple echo times after each excitation pulse. This information can be used to reduce signal dropout and quantitatively identify and remove signal that is unlikely to be neural in origin. Multi-echo fMRI acquisition and processing methods have sufficiently matured to the point where the growing developer and user community would benefit from a discussion of what it’s like to use multi-echo fMRI in practice. In this emergent session, presenters will briefly answer three questions: (1) Why are you using multi-echo fMRI? (2) Are there any challenges of multi-echo fMRI that you’ve addressed and want to highlight? (3) What issue(s) with multi-echo fMRI would you like to see addressed? These presentations will be followed by time for discussion between presenters and attendees.

 If you are interested in presenting in this session or have thoughts for how to organize the session, please contact one of the organizers directly or [comment on issue #1](https://github.com/ME-ICA/ohbm-2021-multiecho/issues/1).
